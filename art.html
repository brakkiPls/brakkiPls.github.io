			<p class="Text"><strong><br>Here you can see the Seasonal Drawings!<br>
				Each month there is a different selection of 3 YCH like drawings that you can get me to draw,
				but you can customize these a lot more than the classic YCH.<br><br>
				<i>You can:</i><br><br>
				- chose your own Character!<br>
				- add accessoires if wanted! (Bandana, Hat, ...)<br>
				- chose your individual Pose and Expression!<br>
				- chose painted or illustrated style (Sample below)<br>
				- etc ...<br><br>
				<i>You can not:</i><br><br>
				- add a second character! (Normal comission prices apply for this)<br>
				- change the main idea of the drawing<br><br>
				Also: These Seasonal Drawings below are just Sketches!
				The actual Art you Comission will be a lot higher quality. (Check out the Samples)<br><br>
				If you are interested in getting a Seasonal Drawing of your Character,
				please message me on Discord (@brakkie).<br><br>
				The Price for any Seasonal Drawing is $25.<br><br>
